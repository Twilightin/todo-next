## Error-Handling Rules

1. Whenever I request error resolution or bug checking, you must:
   - Diagnose the issue.
   - Provide the corrected code or steps to fix it.

2. After fixing the issue, you must update `ErrorNotes.md` with:
   - A concise description of the error.
   - The fix applied.
   (No summaries in the main conversation.)

3. Do not write any summary or recap in your response.  
   Only `ErrorNotes.md` may contain accumulated error notes.
